    Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and
    leaving jokes all over the place: under the king&apos;s pillow, in his soup,
    even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn&apos;t seem to
    stop Jokester. And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that
    the jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn&apos;t help but
    laugh. And once they started laughing, they couldn&apos;t stop.
